Four properties determine an item's location within a grid
- grid-column-start
- grid-column-end
- grid-row-start
- grid-row-end
  - These properties are relative to the Grid Lines

The possible value types for the aforementioned properties are
- <line> - Either a number or named Grid Line
- span <number> (ex: span 3) - Specifies how many tracks a grid item should cover
- span <name> - An item spans across tracks until a line with <name>
- auto
- Example:
.item-a {
  grid-column-start: 2;
  grid-column-end: five;
  grid-row-start: row1-start
  grid-row-end: 3
}

Without grid-column-end/grid-row-end, the item spans 1 track by default

Items can overlap each other -- z-index can be used to control stacking order

Items have a "grid-area" property that can be used for two purposes:
- Allows it to be referenced by grid templates' "grid-template-areas" properties
- Can be used as a shorthand for "grid-row-start", "grid-column-start", etc.

Items have alignment properties
- "justify-self" for row alignment
- "align-self" for column alignment
