While you can make grid items appear out of order, it doesn't affect screen readers or tab order
- This means that a user can potentially tab from the top to the bottom of the screen

Use grid layout for visual reordering of content, not logical reordering
- An example of this is if tab traversal of grid items is out of order
- In this scenario, the markup should be changed instead of the grid layout styling

When developing a page with grid layout, ensure that tab order makes sense
